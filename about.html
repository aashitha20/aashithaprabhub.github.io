    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Driven by a passion to build things that matter, I'm a computer science student with a creative mind and a web developer's toolkit. My goal is to craft digital experiences that are not only powerful but also a joy to use. I'm always chasing the next big idea and the technology that can bring it to life.</p>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    👩‍💻 By day, I’m a <strong>CS Engineer in the making</strong>, solving problems and building digital magic. By night, I’m a <strong>movie buff</strong> who believes every bug fix deserves a popcorn break 🍿.
  </p>
  <p>
    🍳 When I’m not coding, you’ll find me in the kitchen <strong>cooking up experiments</strong>—sometimes recipes, sometimes debugging sessions. I love trying food from different cuisines because hey, good code and good food both deserve taste-testing! 🌍
  </p>
  <p>
    👗 With a <strong>great sense of fashion</strong> (if I do say so myself 😉), I bring the same creativity to tech as I do to outfits—always aiming for style + function. Music is my caffeine 🎶, keeping my flow as smooth as my playlists.
  </p>
  <p>
    🚀 At my core, I’m all about <strong>teamwork, leadership, and turning ideas into impact</strong>. Whether it’s building projects or brainstorming with a team, I love being the spark that gets things moving.
